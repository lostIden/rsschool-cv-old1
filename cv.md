## Briefly About Myself

I like programming, because it allows you to create something new, does not allow you to degrade and opens new doors in front of you.

## My goals

Develop my skills to the senior level, get into a company to which I can offer my skills and hard work, and eventually ideas.
To create a global platform to help stray animals and people, to give them the chance they deserve. I have experience in website layout, in pure HTML5 and CSS. Minimum freelance experience.
Strengths: If you ask me a question to which I do not know the answer, I will answer that I do not know. But, believe me, I know how to find it, this answer, and I will find it.

## Skills
* HTML5
* CSS (SASS/SCSS, BEM)
* JavaScript (Fundamentals, ES6+, DOM, JSON, Asynchronous JavaScript)
